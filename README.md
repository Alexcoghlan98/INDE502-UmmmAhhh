# INDE502-UmmmAhhh

This Repo is for my current Internet Design module INDE 502 - Net Architecture. It follows on from the previous module I had which was
INDE 501 - Net Experience. The previous module was to come up with an application that would prevent any problems that people may face
on a day to day basis. I came up with the idea of a procrastination prevention application. I did all of the relevent research and 
designs for it. So this current module was to take everything we designed in the previous module and actually make the application.

The main idea for my application was to prevent people procrastinating on a daily basis. Procrastination is a huge problem that a lot of
people deal with when they are trying to complete a task or get work done. So, the main aim is to try and change peoples habits. 
One of the biggest parts of my app is the Game/Quiz and social media pages. I have a page where the user is able to complete a quick quiz
in order to continue onto the social media page where they will have the chance to select a social media page of their choice and then
they have a limited amount of time to use that social media page as they desire.

Over the past eight weeks I have been writing and editing code so that I can successfully create the application that I researched and
designed in the previous module. Some parts have been a struggle but at the same time has been very rewarding when my code worked in 
the different areas of my code.
