# INDE502-UmmmAhhh

This Repo is for my current Internet Design module INDE 502 - Net Architecture. It follows on from the previous module I had which was
INDE 501 - Net Experience. The previous module was to come up with an application that would prevent any problems that people may face
on a day to day basis. I came up with the idea of a procrastination prevention application. I did all of the relevent research and 
designs for it. So this current module was to take everything we designed in the previous module and actually make the application. 

Over the past eight weeks I have been writing and editing code so that I can successfully create the application that I researched and
designed in the previous module. Some parts have been a struggle but at the same time has been very rewarding when my code worked in 
the different areas of my code.
